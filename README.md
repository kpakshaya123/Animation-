# Animation-
     <marquee> Tricks using Html and Css.
ðŸ¦‹ Welcome to a tiny spark of creativity on the web!  
This project brings a butterfly to life using nothing more than **HTML** and **CSS**.  
Watch as it gracefully flutters across the screen, turning simple code into a delightful visual experience. ðŸŒ¸  

âœ¨ Whatâ€™s Inside?
- **`animation.html`** â†’ The stage where the butterfly performs.  
- **`animation.css`** â†’ The magic spell (CSS animation) that makes it fly.  
- **`gifimage.gif`** â†’ The butterfly itself, ready to take flight.
